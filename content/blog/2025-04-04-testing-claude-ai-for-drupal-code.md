I tested ClaudeAI for Drupal code, got inspired by [Dries Buytaert video](https://dri.es/claude-code-meets-drupal).

* 🤯 the interaction and suggestions were quite good
* 💵 execution is expensive, I paid $1.16 for 20 minutes
* 🙄 I got annoyed a couple of times, because Claude did contradictory things
