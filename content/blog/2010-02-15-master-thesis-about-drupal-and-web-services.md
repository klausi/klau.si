<p>
	In the last weeks I thought about a topic for my master thesis at the Vienna University of Technology, and I came up with the idea of integrating Drupal and Web Services.</p>

<p>
	Playing around with the new Drupal 7 and the great new <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules 2 module</a> will be very exciting. I already did some <a href="http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/linksites/teaching/courses/Internetapplikationen.html">university courses about web services</a> and I also hacked around a lot in Rules and Drupal - so the foundations are set for a successful project.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m glad that <a href="http://www.amininfo.net/">Amin Anjomshoaa</a> has agreed to supervise the thesis and that <a href="http://more.zites.net">Wolfgang Ziegler</a> will provide me with help and tips around Rules and Drupal, as he already did during <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/21658">my Google Summer of Code project</a> last year.</p>
<p>
	Here is a more detailed <a href="https://klausi.fsinf.at/sites/klausi.fsinf.at/files/initial_concept.pdf">initial concept as PDF</a> of what I&#39;m planning to do.</p>
