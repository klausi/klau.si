<p>Just tested the new Mozilla Thunderbird 3 mailclient, here is a very short review what has changed since version 2.</p>
<!-- more -->
<ul>
    <li>add addresses with one click to the address book (each address has a star button to quickly &quot;bookmark&quot; it)</li>
    <li>summary of a thread is displayed in the preview window, so you can navigate through a thread more quickly. Very handy!</li>
    <li>awesome search! all messages get indexed and you can search like in firefox (awesome bar)</li>
    <li>faceted search, you can refine your search by people, folder etc.</li>
    <li>Enigmail (pgp/gpg addon) currently does not work on linux 64 bit from the remote installer, use this one: http://www.mozilla-enigmail.org/download/release/1.0/</li>
    <li>what's new: http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation on Ubuntu 9.10:</p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install thunderbird-3.0</pre>
