<p>
	I will attend the <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/core-developer-summit">Drupal Core Developer Summit</a> at Drupalcon San Francisco, so I had to prepare a short lighting talk about a topic that bothers me in Drupal. As I ran into an issue of implementing a hook by accident recently, I decided to come up with some suggestions how to improve the situation. I have attached <a href="/sites/klausi.fsinf.at/files/hooks_drupal.pdf">the PDF</a> I will submit.</p>
