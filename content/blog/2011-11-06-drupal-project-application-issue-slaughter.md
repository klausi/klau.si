<p>This is a happy day: the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/projectapplications?status=8">issues needing review</a> count is down to zero at this moment in the Drupal project application issue queue. I have attached a screenshot as proof.</p>
<p><a href="/sites/default/files/Screenshot at 2011-11-07 00%3A22%3A36.png"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/Screenshot%20at%202011-11-07%2000%3A22%3A36.png" style="width: 600px; height: 303px; margin: 10px;" /></a></p>
<p>I started my involvement with project applications a few weeks ago, where <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/187939#comment-620579">we had 250 open issues</a> needing review. I saw it as a challenge to bring this number down radically and invested some hours pursuing it. I even <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1325258">got into community spotlight</a> for this effort, which would not have been possible without the mentorship and support of many people. I want to thank greggles, sreynen, jthorson, ELC and all others that helped to resolve this 250 issue backlog and supported me in my addiction. Keep up the good work!</p>
