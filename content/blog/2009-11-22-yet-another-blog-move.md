<p>While I liked the <a href="https://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0426223/">webspace</a> offered by the Vienna university of technology, I decided to move my Drupal blog to the Drupal farm at fsinf.at. This has two advantages: less administration/update overhead (I'm responsible for Drupal updates on fsinf.at as well) and a much shorter, easy to remember URL.</p>
