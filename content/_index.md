Hi! My name is Klausi. I work as Principal Engineer for [jobiqo](https://www.jobiqo.com). I have a master's degree in software engineering from the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/) where I focused my soft skill part on Gender Studies. I'm also interested in technology, politics and ethics.

You can contact me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@klausi">Mastodon</a>, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/klau.si), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klausi/) or per email. My first name dot my last name (Klaus Purer) @protonmail.ch.

Some projects I work on:

* [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder), a coding standards checker for Drupal
* [GraphQL for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql), a Drupal module that implements a GraphQL server API
* [Mastodon Bluesky Sync](https://github.com/klausi/mastodon-bluesky-sync), a command line tool to synchronize my posts from Mastodon to Bluesky and back
* [D7Security](https://www.d7security.org), unofficial extended security support for Drupal 7
