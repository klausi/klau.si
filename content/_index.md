Hi! My name is Klausi. I work as Principal Engineer for [jobiqo](https://www.jobiqo.com). I have a master's degree in software engineering from the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/) where I focused my soft skill part on Gender Studies. I'm also interested in technology, politics and ethics.

You can contact me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@klausi">Mastodon</a>, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klausi/) or per email. My first name dot my last name (Klaus Purer) @protonmail.ch.

Some projects I work on:

* [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder), a coding standards checker for Drupal
* [Mastodon Twitter Sync](https://github.com/klausi/mastodon-twitter-sync), a tool to synchronize posts between Mastodon and Twitter
